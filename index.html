<header><h3>2007 - Current | Business Analyst</h3></header>
<header><h4>Pratt & Whitney, East Hartford, CT</h4></header>
<p>Developed and managed mission critical software projects surrounding ech data usage for the most advanced weapon systems in the world, 
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22">F-22 Raptor</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35">F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</a>. 
I work closely with US military customers, foreign military customers, and commercial airline customers to deliver software that meets their needs. 
My horizontal involvement in projects spans the entire product lifecycle, from initial concept creation to customer installation and training. 
I specifically enjoy being involved in both the business side and the IT side of a project while working together with both to make a project successful. </p>

<header><h4>Infotech Software Solutions, East Hartford, CT</h4></header>
<p>I was placed in Pratt & Whitney's Maintenance Data Engineering department to work on their commercial engine technical data products.
 I improved their product offerings by incorporating customer feedback and harmonizing features in their different deliverables to create a 
 unified product line. My biggest accomplishment during this time was creating a website that brought together their technical data products
 with the company's enterprise search system to give users in P&W's maintenance facilities an easier way to find the technical data.</p>

<header><h3>2002 - 2004 | Network Administrator</h3></header>
<header><h4>Millennium Institute, New Haven, CT</h4></header>
<p>I managed a network of over 500 PCs spread out over five offices in three states. It was a Windows based network and utilized Cisco equipment 
for the network devices. My main projects during this time were standing up a new office, migration of the network from Windows 2000 to Windows
2003 and XP, and establishing redundancy by putting backup servers at all the sites. Millennium Institute was an IT certification school and I 
would fill in as a substitute instructor for Microsoft and CompTIA certification classes when needed.</p>
